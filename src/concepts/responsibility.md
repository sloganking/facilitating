## Most People Don't Understand Responsibility

Here's the problem: most people have a broken understanding of what responsibility even means.

They think:

- Responsibility is what the **perpetrator** takes after making a mistake
- The **victim** is the one who demands responsibility
- The victim has nothing to be responsible for
- Responsibility = punishment for wrongdoing

This is completely wrong.

And because of this misunderstanding, you see dynamics like:

- Someone makes a mistake
- A group gathers and says "You need to take responsibility!"
- Meanwhile, none of the accusers are taking any responsibility themselves
- For their [mob judgment](./before-you-judge.md), for their [over-response](./appropriate-response.md), for their role in what happened

Everyone is pointing fingers. No one is looking at themselves.

## What Responsibility Actually Means

Responsibility means asking:

> **What happened? How did my actions play a part in creating this outcome? What can I do in the future to create something else I want instead?**

That's it. It's not about fault. It's not about punishment. It's not about being "the bad guy."

It's about recognizing your power and using it intentionally.

## Everyone Has Responsibility

In any interaction between two or more people, **everyone** has responsibility for the outcome.

Not just the "perpetrator." Not just the person who made the most obvious mistake. Everyone.

| Person                                | Has Responsibility For                             |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| The person who crossed a boundary     | Their actions, their awareness, their check-ins    |
| The person whose boundary was crossed | Their communication, their fawning, their response |
| The bystanders                        | Their judgment, their verification, their response |
| The facilitators                      | The container, their intervention, their process   |

"Victim" is not a get-out-of-responsibility-free card.

Having been wronged doesn't mean you have nothing to look at.

## Responsibility ≠ Blame

This is critical to understand. **Responsibility and blame are opposites.**

| Blame                  | Responsibility               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Backward-looking       | Forward-looking              |
| "You caused this"      | "How did I contribute?"      |
| "You're bad"           | "What can I do differently?" |
| Assigns fault          | Recognizes power             |
| Disempowers the blamer | Empowers the responsible     |
| Creates victims        | Creates creators             |

### Why Blame Feels Good But Hurts You

When you blame someone, you get a hit of righteousness. It feels good. "I'm right, they're wrong. They're the problem, not me."

But here's what blame actually does:

**Blame gives your power away.**

When you say "You caused this," you're saying "You have the power here. I was just a passive recipient of your actions."

When you say "It's your fault," you're saying "I couldn't have done anything different. I had no control."

When you point the finger outward, you deny your own agency.

**The person you blame the most is the person you give the most power to.**

Think about it:

- If they caused it, they control it
- If they control it, only they can fix it
- If only they can fix it, you're helpless until they change

Blame feels like power. It's actually the opposite. It's a declaration of your own powerlessness.

### What Responsibility Gives You

When you take responsibility—even for things that weren't "your fault"—you're saying:

- I had power here
- I can see how I contributed
- I can do something different next time
- I'm not a victim of circumstance
- My future is in my hands

This is the [Creator](./drama-triangle.md) mindset. It's the opposite of [Victim](./drama-triangle.md).

## Why People Don't Take Responsibility

1. **They don't see their power** — If you don't recognize your control, you can't take responsibility for it
2. **They've been taught they're powerless** — Society often encourages victimhood over agency
3. **Trauma has convinced them the world happens TO them** — Their filters say they're not safe, not in control
4. **Taking responsibility feels like admitting fault** — They confuse responsibility with blame
5. **It's easier to point outward than look inward** — Self-examination is uncomfortable

### How to Help Someone Take Responsibility

Instead of lecturing someone on morality:

- Show them their own power
- Show them they can create a different outcome
- Once they see their power, responsibility follows naturally

People can't take responsibility for things they believe they have no control over. The key is helping them see their control.

## Omni-Responsible

You are responsible for everything in your life that you have the power to influence.

Not because you caused everything. But because you can influence it.

Even when someone else made the mistake, you can ask:

- How did I contribute to this situation?
- What could I have done differently?
- What will I do differently next time?

This isn't self-blame. It's self-empowerment.

## The Accusers Who Don't Take Responsibility

Watch for this pattern:

1. Something happens
2. A group forms to condemn someone
3. "You need to take responsibility!"
4. But the accusers aren't taking any themselves

They're not asking:

- Did I verify before judging? ([Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md))
- Is my response proportional? ([Appropriate Response](./appropriate-response.md))
- Am I acting from Persecutor? ([Drama Triangle](./drama-triangle.md))
- Do I even know what happened?

They're pointing fingers while refusing to look at their own hands.

**Demanding responsibility from others while taking none yourself is hypocrisy.**

And often, the mob does more harm than the original incident.
