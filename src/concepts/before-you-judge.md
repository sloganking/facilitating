## The Problem

When something happens in a community, people form opinions fast.

They see someone angry. They see someone apologizing. They assume the angry person must be justified and the apologizing person must be guilty.

**This is not evidence. This is vibes.**

## The Witch Hunt Dynamic

Here's what often happens:

1. Person A wrongs Person B (or B _believes_ they were wronged)
2. Person B gets very angry, treats it as [high severity](./severity.md)
3. Person A [fawns](./fawning.md), apologizes, appeases
4. Bystanders see: angry person + apologizing person
5. Bystanders assume: "They must have done something bad"
6. A witch hunt begins based on **zero actual information**

The bystanders never asked what happened. They never heard from primary sources. They just read the room and picked a side.

## Most People Aren't Predators

Here's something important, based on lived experience in these spaces:

**Nine times out of ten, when something goes wrong, it's not malice. It's a mistake made by a good person.**

They weren't trying to harm anyone. They misread a signal. They got caught up in a moment. They didn't notice something they should have. They're horrified when they realize what happened, and they want to fix it.

But we don't act like this is true. We act like predators are everywhere.

### The Fear That Distorts Everything

We carry stories in our heads:

- Stories of rapists
- Stories of abusers
- Stories of powerful people who don't care who they hurt
- Cultural mythology that the wealthy/successful/confident are selfish and predatory

These stories make us afraid. And fear makes us see threats that aren't there.

When something happens, our fear whispers: "This could be one of _those_ people." And we lean toward interpreting their actions as malicious—even when overwhelmingly, they're not.

### The Reality in These Spaces

In sex-positive and somatic communities specifically:

- These are often small, interconnected spaces where everyone knows each other
- Actual predators get identified and removed quickly
- Most people are there specifically because they value consent and care
- The overwhelming majority of incidents are good-faith mistakes

If you've been in these spaces, you've probably seen this: someone makes a mistake, gets treated like a monster, and everyone later realizes it was a miscommunication with a person who genuinely wanted to do better.

### What This Means for You

Before you judge someone as malicious, consider:

- Is there a good-faith explanation for what happened?
- Would a well-meaning person have made this mistake?
- Are you assuming the worst because you're afraid, not because you have evidence?

**The person you're judging is probably not a predator. They're probably someone like you who messed up.**

That doesn't mean there are no consequences. That doesn't mean harm didn't happen. But it does mean your response should match the reality—a mistake by a good person—not the fear of what they _could_ have been.

## Are You a Qualified Source?

Before you judge someone, before you assess [severity](./severity.md), before you take any action—ask yourself:

> **Do I actually know what happened?**

### The Checklist

| Question                                       | If No...                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Have I talked to the people directly involved? | You're missing primary sources              |
| Have I heard from _all_ sides?                 | You only have part of the story             |
| Have I verified my interpretation with them?   | Your story about what happened may be wrong |
| Is my source biased? (angry, hurt, has stakes) | Their account may be distorted              |
| Was my source even there?                      | They're passing on gossip                   |

**If you answered "no" to these, your opinion is unqualified.**

### Witnessing Isn't Enough

Even if you saw something with your own eyes, you are not automatically qualified.

Why? Because the moment you witness something, you create a **story** about what you saw. And that story is filtered through your biases, assumptions, and trauma.

You might see:

- Two people interacting
- One person looking upset
- The other person leaving

And you create a story: "That person did something wrong."

But you don't know:

- What was said
- What was agreed to beforehand
- What either person was actually feeling
- Whether your interpretation matches reality

**Witnessing is raw data. Your interpretation of that data can be completely wrong.**

The only way to know if your story is true is to **verify with the people involved**. If you haven't done that, you don't actually know what happened—you just have a story you made up.

You don't know what to believe yet. And that's okay—it's honest.

## Primary Sources Matter

A **primary source** is someone who was directly involved in or witnessed the incident.

A **secondary source** is someone who heard about it from someone else.

If your only information comes from secondary sources:

- You don't know if they did their due diligence
- You don't know what was lost in translation
- You don't know what was added or distorted
- You're trusting human telephone

**Human nature is to assume things without evidence.** Don't trust that others verified before forming their opinion.

## The Fawning Trap

When someone [fawns](./fawning.md) after being accused or confronted:

- They apologize reflexively
- They try to de-escalate
- They look guilty even when they're not

Bystanders read this as confirmation: "See, they're apologizing, they must have done it."

**Apology is not admission of guilt.** It may be a trauma response.

### The Hidden Disagreement

Here's what bystanders don't see: the person fawning may **completely disagree** that they deserve what's happening.

If the accuser feels like a genuine threat—someone who could hurt their reputation, rally others against them, or escalate further—the fawner's survival instinct kicks in. They appease. They don't stand up for themselves. They just try to get through the moment alive.

Internally, they may be thinking:

- "This is bullshit, but I'm scared"
- "They're overreacting, but they're too angry to hear me"
- "If I push back, this gets worse"

So they apologize. Not because they agree. Because they're afraid.

**Apology under threat is not agreement. It's survival.**

## What To Do Instead

### If you're a bystander:

1. **Suspend judgment** until you have primary information
2. **Ask directly**: "Can you tell me what happened?"
3. **Hear all sides** before forming an opinion
4. **Consider bias**: Is this person angry? Hurt? Do they have stakes?
5. **Recognize your limits**: "I don't know enough to have an opinion on this"

### If you're being judged unfairly:

1. Recognize that bystanders are operating on incomplete information
2. Consider telling your side to primary witnesses who can vouch
3. Ask: "Do you actually know what happened, or are you going on what you've heard?"

### If you're a facilitator:

1. Don't let witch hunts form from vibes
2. Gather primary source accounts before taking action
3. Recognize when the "victim" may be [over-responding](./appropriate-response.md)
4. Protect people from mob judgment based on gossip

## The Standard

> **Before I judge, I need to know. Before I know, I need to verify. If I haven't verified, my opinion is unqualified.**

Not having an opinion is more honest than having an uninformed one.
