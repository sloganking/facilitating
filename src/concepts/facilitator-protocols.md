## The Core Principle: Walk Your Talk

Nothing matters more for a facilitator than alignment between what you say and what you do.

You can teach about consent, boundaries, and dignity all day. But what people learn is what they see you do when it's hard.

**Show, don't tell.**

If you say everyone deserves dignity and respect, but you let someone treat you like shit because you're scared of them—you've just taught everyone that dignity is negotiable when someone gets angry enough.

If you say mistakes don't require leaving the container, but you kick someone out because an angry participant scared you into it—you've just taught everyone that mob pressure wins.

Your actions are louder than your words. Every time.

## Everyone Deserves Dignity and Respect

### The Puja Principle

In tantra, there's a ritual called the puja—a practice of worshipping each other as gods and goddesses. The idea is to see the divine in each other and yourself.

For many people, this is the first time they've ever been treated with such reverence, appreciation, and dignity. It's profound. It's awakening. And afterward, many decide:

> "This is how I want to be treated for the rest of my life. I'm going to have boundaries and only allow people into my life who treat me as divine."

This isn't arrogance. It's self-worth.

### The Principle to Carry

We're all powerful creators, even if we don't recognize it yet. We're all valuable. We're all worth being treated with dignity and respect.

**None of us should be treated like crap.**

This isn't just a nice idea. It's a core value that should govern how you run your container—and how you allow yourself to be treated within it.

## When Someone Attacks You

Here's where it gets hard.

Someone is angry. They're doing character assassination. They're calling you names—predator, abuser, whatever. They're playing victim loudly. They might be threatening your reputation.

The temptation—especially for facilitators and staff—is to fawn. To appease. To let them treat you badly because:

- "Facilitators are supposed to stay calm"
- "I don't want to escalate"
- "They might write hate mail"
- "Maybe I deserve this"

**This is wrong.**

### The Appropriate Response

If someone is speaking to you without dignity and respect, you don't fawn. You set a boundary.

**For participants and assistants:**

> "I can see you're angry, and I'm open to having a conversation about what happened. But I'm not available for being spoken to this way. Until you're willing to speak to me with dignity and respect, you're going to have to handle your emotions on your own."

Then disengage. You don't owe them your presence while they attack you.

If you're at a retreat and can't leave, talk to the facilitators. Set a boundary that this person doesn't interact with you unless they can treat you with dignity and respect.

**For staff:**

The same applies. Being staff doesn't mean you forfeit your right to be treated with respect.

If you model "staff don't defend themselves," you're teaching participants that they can treat you like shit and nothing will happen. You're showing that your values are negotiable.

That's not the lesson you want to teach.

### What You're Modeling

When you set a boundary with someone who's attacking you, you model:

- Self-respect is non-negotiable
- Dignity applies to everyone—including the accused
- Anger doesn't grant permission to abuse
- Values hold even when things get hard

When you fawn and appease, you model:

- Anger wins
- If you're loud enough, you get your way
- Facilitators/staff are afraid of participants
- The person crying victim controls the container

**Which lesson do you want participants to learn?**

## The Facilitator's Dilemma

Lead facilitators face a unique challenge.

You're responsible for the container. You're supposed to hold space for everyone. You're supposed to stay calm. There's an expectation that you'll be the adult in the room.

But that doesn't mean you accept abuse.

_[Section in development: How lead facilitators should respond when being attacked. The principle is clear—you don't take it—but the specific approach needs refinement.]_

---

## Threats of Violence Must Be Stopped Immediately

This is non-negotiable.

If a participant is making threats of physical violence—whether verbal ("I'll hurt you") or through physical intimidation (getting in someone's face, implying "if you disagree with me, I will assault you")—you must handle it immediately.

Not after the sharing circle. Not when things calm down. **Immediately.**

### Why Immediate Action Is Critical

Here's what happens if you don't act:

**Scenario:** A participant gets angry. They storm up to someone who disagreed with them, getting within inches of their face. Their body language screams violence. A facilitator eventually steps in—but everyone saw that if they'd decided to throw a punch, the facilitators probably wouldn't have stopped them in time.

**What you just showed everyone:**

- If you upset the angry person, we won't actually protect you
- Threats of violence are tolerated in this container
- The angry person has more power than the facilitators
- Your safety depends on not disagreeing with aggressive people

**What happens next:**

The container is no longer valid. People don't feel safe. Every share from that point forward is filtered through fear. The sharing circles aren't real shares anymore—they're performances designed to not upset the person who might hurt them.

You've lost the container. The angry person is now running your event.

### The Standard

Someone who creates a source of unsafety for other participants, staff, or facilitators must be:

1. **Given an immediate, clear boundary**: "You cannot threaten people here. If you continue, you will need to leave."
2. **Removed if they continue**: Not tomorrow. Not after they calm down. Now.

You cannot let someone making threats of violence—whether implied or explicit, whether "just" intimidation or actual death threats—stay in your environment.

If you do, you are:

- Allowing them to run your container
- Showing everyone that fear wins
- Demonstrating that your boundaries are negotiable
- Creating an environment where no one feels protected

### This Is Not Optional

Some facilitators think: "But they're activated. They're just scared. They don't mean it. I should hold space for them."

No.

Holding space does not mean tolerating threats of violence against other participants. Their activation is their responsibility. Your responsibility is the safety of everyone else in the container.

You can have compassion for someone's pain AND remove them from the space. These are not mutually exclusive.

### What You're Showing

| If You Act Immediately       | If You Hesitate or Don't Act           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| "We will protect you"        | "We can't protect you"                 |
| "Threats aren't tolerated"   | "Threats are tolerated if loud enough" |
| "The container is safe"      | "The container is not safe"            |
| "Facilitators are in charge" | "The angriest person is in charge"     |

Your actions in this moment define whether your container is real or theater.

## When You See Someone Fawning

Sometimes you'll witness a dynamic where one participant is being belligerent—attacking, accusing, name-calling—and the other is just... taking it. Appeasing. Not defending themselves.

They're [fawning](./fawning.md).

As a facilitator, you have a choice. You could just watch. Or you could help.

### The Intervention

If you see someone fawning to an aggressor, consider stepping in—not to fight their battle for them, but to support them in fighting it themselves.

**What this might look like:**

- Quietly: "Hey, I notice you're not being spoken to with respect. You can set a boundary here. I have your back."
- More directly: "It looks like you might be appeasing right now. You don't have to accept being treated this way. What do you actually want to say?"
- To both parties: "Let's pause. [Fawner], I want to make sure you're able to speak freely here. Do you feel safe to say what you actually think?"

### Why This Matters

The lesson you're teaching is one of the most important ones:

> **I can't keep you safe. Only you can. But I'll support you while you do it.**

Until someone learns to stand up for themselves, they'll continue to be treated badly. They'll continue to receive punishment they don't deserve. They'll continue to create situations where they're the victim—because they won't set boundaries.

By prompting them to set a boundary—and backing them up when they do—you're helping them learn to protect themselves. That's more valuable than protecting them yourself.

### Considerations

- **They might not be ready.** You can prompt and support, but you can't force someone to stand up for themselves before they're able. If they can't do it yet, that's okay. The seed is planted.

- **Don't put them on the spot.** A quiet word of support is often more effective than announcing to the room "I think you're fawning."

- **Timing matters.** Sometimes you need to de-escalate first, then coach afterward. Sometimes real-time prompting is exactly what they need. Read the situation.

- **Model what you're asking.** If you're asking them to set boundaries with someone being aggressive, make sure you're doing the same. Show, don't just tell.

### What You're Showing

When you help someone recognize their fawning and support them in setting boundaries, you model:

- Self-respect can be learned
- Facilitators aren't here to rescue you—they're here to empower you
- You have the right to be treated with dignity, and the responsibility to enforce it
- The container supports people standing up for themselves

This is the [Creator](./drama-triangle.md) dynamic, not the Rescuer dynamic. You're not saving them. You're helping them save themselves.

## Show, Don't Tell

Your participants learn more from what you do than what you say.

| What You Say                    | What You Do                                  | What They Learn                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Everyone deserves respect"     | You let someone disrespect you               | Respect is optional when angry   |
| "Mistakes don't mean leaving"   | You kick someone out under pressure          | Mob pressure wins                |
| "We verify before judging"      | You take action based on one side            | Verification is lip service      |
| "Proportional responses matter" | You let HIGH responses to LOW mistakes slide | Severity doesn't actually matter |

**If your actions contradict your words, your actions are what people remember.**

This is why walking your talk is the most important thing as a facilitator. Not your curriculum. Not your marketing. Not your reputation.

Your integrity.

## What to Do When Someone Reports

_[Section in development: Protocol for when a participant reports an incident]_

1. Listen first, without judgment
2. Gather primary source information from all parties
3. Assess severity based on what actually happened
4. Respond proportionally
5. Don't let the reporter's emotional intensity determine your response
6. Remember: the reporter may be over-responding, fawning, or creating a story
