## Prevention Is the Happy Path

Most of what this book covers is what to do when things go wrong. But the best way to handle mistakes is to prevent them.

Before engaging in play, intimacy, or sex with someone, have a conversation. Not just "do you consent?"—a real conversation that covers the things that, if you don't discuss them, often turn into the mistakes this book is about.

## RBDSMT: The Safer Sex Conversation

This framework comes from ISTA (International School of Temple Arts), with one addition. It stands for:

- **R** — Relationships
- **B** — Boundaries
- **D** — Desires
- **S** — Sexual Health
- **M** — Meaning
- **T** — Trauma

Before playing with someone—especially someone new—talk through each of these. It takes 10-20 minutes. It can save hours of pain, confusion, and repair.

## R — Relationships

**What to discuss:** What are your current relationship structures? Who else is involved? What agreements do you have with others?

**Why it matters:** Playing with someone who has a partner you don't know about, or violating agreements they have with someone else, can create HIGH severity harm—not just to them, but to third parties.

**Example questions:**

- "Are you in any relationships right now?"
- "Do you have any agreements with partners that affect what we can do?"
- "Is there anyone who would be hurt or surprised by this?"
- "Is there anyone I should know about?"

---

## B — Boundaries

**What to discuss:** What's okay? What's not okay? What are your hard limits? What are your soft limits?

**Why it matters:** Unstated boundaries are the most common source of accidental harm. If you don't know their limits, you can't respect them. If they don't state them, they're more likely to [fawn](./fawning.md) when something doesn't feel right.

**Example questions:**

- "What's off-limits for you?"
- "What are your hard no's?"
- "Is there anything you'd want me to check in about before doing?"
- "How do you like to communicate if something isn't working?"
- "What's your safeword, if you use one?"

---

## D — Desires

**What to discuss:** What do you actually want from this experience? What are you hoping for? What would make this great for you?

**Why it matters:** If you don't know what each other wants, you're guessing. Guessing leads to mismatches. Mismatches lead to disappointment or harm.

**Example questions:**

- "What are you hoping for from this?"
- "What would make this really good for you?"
- "Is there anything specific you'd love to experience?"
- "What are you curious about?"

---

## S — Sexual Health

**What to discuss:** STI status, testing history, safer sex practices, barriers, birth control.

**Why it matters:** This is about physical safety and informed consent. You can't consent to a risk you don't know about.

**Example questions:**

- "When were you last tested? For what?"
- "Is there anything I should know about your sexual health?"
- "What safer sex practices do you want to use?"
- "What are your preferences around barriers?"
- "If relevant: What's your birth control situation?"

---

## M — Meaning

**What to discuss:** What does this mean to you? Is this casual or significant? What are your expectations afterward?

**Why it matters:** Mismatched meaning creates hurt. If one person thinks this is the start of a relationship and the other thinks it's a one-time thing, someone's getting hurt—and it's preventable.

**Example questions:**

- "What does this mean to you?"
- "What are your expectations for after?"
- "Is this casual for you, or something more?"
- "How do you usually feel after intimacy? Is there anything you need?"

---

## T — Trauma

**What to discuss:** Do you have any trauma that might get activated? What does activation look like for you? What should I do if it happens?

**Why it matters:** Trauma can turn a consensual experience into a dissociative nightmare. If you know their triggers and warning signs, you can navigate around them—or at least respond appropriately if something comes up.

**Example questions:**

- "Is there anything from your past that might get activated during play?"
- "Are there any touches, words, or situations I should avoid?"
- "What does it look like when you're activated or triggered?"
- "What would you want me to do if that happens?"
- "Do you have any [fawning](./fawning.md) patterns I should watch for?"

That last question is powerful. If they tell you upfront that they tend to fawn, you can watch for it and check in when their "yes" doesn't feel like a yes.

## This Is Taking Responsibility

Having this conversation before play is [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md) proactively.

You're not waiting for something to go wrong and then trying to repair it. You're creating the conditions for things to go right.

**For facilitators:** Teaching participants to have this conversation before play is part of preparing them for temple nights and open play. If you skip this education, you're setting people up for the mistakes this book is about.

See: [Facilitator Protocols](./facilitator-protocols.md) — the responsible vs. irresponsible approach.

## It Doesn't Have to Be Awkward

Some people resist these conversations because they feel clinical or mood-killing.

But:

1. **It can be sexy.** Talking about desires is foreplay. Knowing what someone wants makes it better.

2. **It builds trust.** Someone who's willing to have this conversation is someone who cares about your experience.

3. **It prevents way more awkwardness than it creates.** A 15-minute conversation now prevents hours of processing, repair, and drama later.

4. **It's a filter.** Someone who won't have this conversation is telling you something about how they'll handle things when they go wrong.
