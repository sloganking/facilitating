## How Feelings Actually Work

Most people believe their feelings are caused by what happens to them.

**This is false.**

Your feelings are caused by the **stories you tell yourself** about what happened.

```

This concept comes from _Crucial Conversations_ and transforms how you understand emotional reactions—yours and others'.

### The Same Experience, Different Feelings

Consider death.

In our culture, death is treated as inherently tragic. We assume grief is the natural, unavoidable response to losing someone.

But in other cultures:

- Death is **joyous**—a celebration of the person's transition
- Death is **neutral**—just part of the cycle
- Children hold the severed limbs of deceased grandparents without distress

Same experience. Completely different feelings.

The difference isn't the death. It's the **story** about what death means.

### Any Feeling to Any Stimulus

This means something profound:

> **Humans can feel any emotion in response to any experience—because we can have any story in our heads.**

Someone touches you without asking:

- Story: "They're a predator testing my boundaries" → Fear, violation
- Story: "They're socially awkward and didn't know better" → Mild annoyance
- Story: "They felt connected to me and got carried away" → Compassion, maybe flattery

Same touch. Same person. Completely different emotional experiences—based entirely on the story.

### The Story Happens Instantly

Here's the tricky part: **you don't notice the story.**

The experience happens. The feeling arrives. It seems like the experience _caused_ the feeling directly.

But there was a story in between. It happened so fast you didn't see it.

This is why two people can witness the exact same event and have completely opposite emotional reactions. They're not reacting to the event—they're reacting to their stories about the event.

## What Trauma Actually Is

Trauma is a **story stored in the body.**

It's not just a memory. It's a meaning-making pattern that runs automatically, below conscious awareness, telling you:

> "You are in danger. This is an emergency. Take action NOW."

When something in the present resembles something from the past—even vaguely—the trauma pattern activates. The body floods with stress hormones. The thinking brain goes offline. And one of four automatic responses takes over:

### The Four Trauma Responses

| Response   | What It Looks Like                       | The Story Running                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Fight**  | Aggression, pushing back, attacking      | "I must destroy the threat"       |
| **Flight** | Leaving, avoiding, running away          | "I must escape the threat"        |
| **Freeze** | Going still, shutting down, dissociating | "If I don't move, maybe it stops" |
| **Fawn**   | People-pleasing, agreeing, appeasing     | "If I make them happy, I'm safe"  |

None of these are conscious choices. They're automatic programs running from old stories.

### The Problem: Old Stories, New Situations

Trauma responses were adaptive once. They helped you survive something.

The problem is they keep running **even when the danger is gone.**

Someone makes an innocent mistake, and your body screams "PREDATOR!" Someone asks you a question, and you freeze. Someone expresses disappointment, and you fawn to make it okay.

The experience is new. But you're reacting to an old story.

## The Problem in Sex-Positive Spaces

When a boundary violation occurs, what do you assume about the person who made it?

- Do you assume the best or the worst?
- What meaning do you ascribe to mistakes?
- Do you know you have trauma that causes your interpretations to lean a certain way?

### How Trauma Distorts Everything

Trauma creates subconscious filters. You may not even know you have trauma. It may just be one of those filters you view the world through.

**A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.**

Whatever comes up—whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it—you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters, **which are not necessarily real.**

Someone's hand brushes your thigh:

- Without trauma filter: "That was probably accidental. I'll mention my boundary if it happens again."
- With trauma filter: "They're testing me. This is how it starts. I need to protect myself."

Both interpretations create very different [appropriate responses](./appropriate-response.md).

One leads to a simple conversation. The other might lead to accusations, witch hunts, or [high-severity](./severity.md) responses to a low-severity mistake.

## Limiting Beliefs & Primary Questions

(Concept from Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny)

There may be a single sentence running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world.

Examples:

- "People always hurt me"
- "I'm not safe"
- "Men/women can't be trusted"
- "I have to protect myself at all costs"
- "If I let my guard down, I'll be taken advantage of"
- "People only want one thing from me"

These aren't conscious beliefs you chose. They were installed by experiences—often in childhood—and they run automatically.

These filters will distort:

- How you interpret others' [types of mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md)
- How you assess [severity](./severity.md)
- Whether your [response is appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)
- Whether you see someone as a predator or a person who made a mistake

## Checking Your Stories

The good news: once you understand that feelings come from stories, you can **check your stories.**

Before you react, pause and ask:

1. **What happened?** (Just the facts—what a camera would have recorded)
2. **What story am I telling myself about it?**
3. **Is that story definitely true, or is it an assumption?**
4. **What other stories could explain what happened?**

This is the core of the [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) tool—a practical technique for separating experience from interpretation.

### Example

**Experience:** He touched my lower back without asking.

**My story:** He's testing my boundaries to see what he can get away with. This is predatory behavior.

**Possible alternative stories:**

- He's affectionate and thought we had a connection
- In his culture, that touch is normal and friendly
- He wasn't thinking and did it automatically
- He genuinely didn't know I'd mind

**What would help:** Asking him directly. Using [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) to check instead of assuming.

## Responsibility When You Have Trauma

Having trauma is **not your fault.**

How you handle it when interacting with others **is your responsibility.**

This isn't blame. It's [empowerment](./responsibility.md). You're the only one who can:

- Know your triggers
- Communicate them when possible
- Pause before reacting
- Ask: "Is this about NOW or about THEN?"
- Check your stories before acting on them
- Take [100% control](../tools/100-percent-control.md) of your safety

### The Hard Truth

Your trauma responses can harm others.

If your body screams "PREDATOR!" and you act on that—spreading warnings, starting witch hunts, destroying someone's reputation—you may be creating [high-severity](./severity.md) harm to someone who made an innocent mistake.

Your fear felt real. Your story felt true. But the consequences you created are still your responsibility.

This isn't fair. You didn't ask for trauma. But the people you harm didn't ask for your trauma responses either.

### The Path Forward

Healing isn't about suppressing your responses. It's about:

1. **Recognizing** when you're reacting to old stories
2. **Pausing** before taking action
3. **Checking** your story with the people involved
4. **Choosing** your response consciously instead of automatically

Over time, with practice and often with support, the old stories lose their grip. The gap between trigger and response grows longer. You gain the ability to feel the fear without acting from it.

This is what it means to take responsibility for your trauma while also having compassion for yourself.
